# khezy-kit 🇰🇭

A collection of core Java utility libraries and domain abstractions designed to simplify common development tasks.

## 🚀 Purpose

khezy-kit serves as the "engine room" for the KHEZY ecosystem. It provides the pure Java logic, interfaces, and base implementations for tasks that are repeated across every project—such as 
storage abstractions, and security utilities—allowing you to focus on your application's unique business logic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Language: Java (LTS)
- **Build System**: Gradle (utilizing Composite Builds for modularity)

## 📦 Key Features & Modules

- **Storage Abstractions**: Unified interfaces for handling file storage and data persistence patterns.
- **Domain Kits**: Base classes and interfaces that enforce clean architecture and consistent data structures.

## 💡 Philosophy

As part of the KHEZY (Khmer + Easy) initiative, this repository is designed to be "Simple and Easy." It aims to provide high-quality, professional-grade tools that are accessible to developers 
who want to build robust systems without the steep learning curve of complex frameworks.

Developed with ❤️ during free time to empower the developer community.
